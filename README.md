## About The Project
https://tgold90.github.io/SUPER-QUIZ-TIME/

Super Quiz Time is a basic quiz for entry levels developers.

## Usage

- Upon loading the site, the user is presented with a Timer set to 45 seconds, the header "Super Quiz Time", and the quiz area with a start button.

- When the start button is clicked the user will see the first question. Whenever an answer is selected, the quiz area will change to show the content of the next question. There are 5 questions total.

- If the user selects an incorrect answer, 7 seconds will be removed from the timer. (a message will display "-7 Seconds!" near the timer).

- When time runs out OR the user has answered all questions, the time remaining will be the user's score. The user can input their initials and press enter.

- If the mouse is hovered over the "HIGHSCORES" button, a text field will show that includes all highscores saved to the local storage of that browser.

- When a highscore is submitted, the webpage will automatically reload to its default.
